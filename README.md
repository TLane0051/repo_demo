Created Bio for README

Howdy! My name is Jameson Lane, but I prefer to be called by my middle name, Tyler, and I am from the great state of Mississippi. My hobbies include hunting, fishing, video games, and spending time with family/friends. I am an active serviceman in the US Air Force. I am a certified Electrician and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State University. One thing I like about myself is my personality and unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
